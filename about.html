        <p>I was born in Lukovska banja, it is a small place on the slopes of Kopaonik, I recently moved to Novi Sad in search of a job. I decided to become a front-end developer, but my goal is to become a full stack developer, so I hope we will  help me with that.
            For myself, I can say that I am persistent, dedicated to my work, I don't give up and I am accurate in every sense. My life motto is:<br><br> <span class="moto"> "If someone made it, why can't I learn it?"</span></p>

                            I heard about programming for the first time in my final year of computer science classes and it was very interesting to me. It started to interest me more and I decided to finish my economic career. And I start a new one, which is programming.</p>

                        <p>After high school, I was immediately determined which faculty I would attend. And after the first lecture  at the faculty, I knew that I was not wrong about my decision.
                            
                    At the faculty, we learned everything about information technology. Python, c#, c, c++, java, assembler, mySql, Php, java-script. Out of all those fields, I found myself in Web Development. I even graduated in that field. After After three years of basic studies, I extended my education and enrolled in specialist studies that lasted one year.</p>
